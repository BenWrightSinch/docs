This document outlines how to administrate numbers through the same endpoints used by the Sinch dashboard. It has two logical steps:

  - Starting a session:
      - Logging in
      - Creating an instance
      - Retrieving your account’s organisation data
  - Working with the “number” endpoints.
      - Listing available numbers
      - Reserving a quantity of numbers
      - Checking out the reservation
      - Listing numbers on the account or attached to an application
      - Assigning to an application
      - Unassigning from an application

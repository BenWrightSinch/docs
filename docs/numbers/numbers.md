The Sinch Numbers API enables you to make and receive calls from your customers, as well as send and receive messages via [searched](https://developers.sinch.com/reference#numberservice_listavailablenumbers) and [rented](https://developers.sinch.com/reference#numberservice_rentnumber) numbers in 15 countries.

With the Sinch Numbers API, you will:

* Gain trust with your customers when you use unique, dedicated numbers to represent your business.

* Become a familiar face in local markets around the world when you use a local number that is specific for every area code.

* Protect peopleâ€™s sensitive information with an anonymous number and create a fraud proof service via number masking.

* Use MO numbers to receive messages, completely free of charge, from your customers.

* Stay available to everyone with reception, and never worry about which country they're in.

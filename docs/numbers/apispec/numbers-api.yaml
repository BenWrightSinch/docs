    protobufAny:
      type: object
      properties:
        typeUrl:
          type: string
          description: |-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
            protocol buffer message. This string MUST contain at least
            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form. A
            leading "." is not accepted.
            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)
            Note: This functionality is not currently available in the official
            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
            type.googleapis.com.
            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
            used with implementation specific semantics.
        value:

          format: byte
          description: Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type
      description: |-
        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.
        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.
        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++
            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }
        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java
            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }
         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python
            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...
         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go
             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
             any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
             ...
             foo := &pb.Foo{}
             if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
               ...
             }
        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
        name "y.z".
        JSON
        ====
        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. 
        Example:
            package google.profile;
            message Person {
              string first_name = 1;
              string last_name = 2;
            }
            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
              "firstName": <string>,
              "lastName": <string>
            }
        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):
            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
              "value": "1.212s"
            }

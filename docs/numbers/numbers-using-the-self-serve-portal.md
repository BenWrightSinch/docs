## Search and buy numbers

Use different criteria to search and buy numbers for SMS, Voice or both. All countries where Sinch has numbers in inventory will be marked as “**Direct Buy**”. All other countries will require you to submit a request to Sinch for manual handling. 


Search numbers

To search and buy numbers, log in to your dashboard and take these steps:
  1. Go to **Buy Numbers** under the **Numbers** heading in **Communication APIs**.
  2. Select your country, then under **Number**, filter your number search by “**Starts with**”, “**Contains**” or “**Ends with**”. If you want a specific number, just type the number into the  box.
  3. Select the **Type** of number you want. **Local (Direct Buy)**, **Toll-free number** or **Short code**.

When you buy a number, some pre-requisites might be needed depending on the country specific requirements. In this example, no supporting documentation is needed and you can click **BUY NUMBER**.

However, in this example, supporting documentation is needed.

  1. Go to Supporting Documentation under **Communication APIs** and click **NEW BUNDLE**

  2. Name your bundle. This will be the name of the supporting documentation that will be shown in the portal.
  3. Select your **Number type** and the **Country** you want to buy your number in.
  4. Click **CREATE**.

  5. Fill in the bundle details and click **SUBMIT TO REVIEW**.

Often the bundle is approved instantly, but in some cases, a manual approval is needed. If so, you will be notified via Email when the bundle is approved.

The Sinch SDK is a product that makes adding voice calling and/or instant messaging to mobile apps easy. It handles all the complexity of signaling and audio management while providing you the freedom to create a stunning user interface.

This document provides an overview for developers integrating with Sinch SDK for the first time. It outlines the prerequisites and guides you through the process of setting up and answering calls as well as sending and receiving instant messages.

Please see the [Reference Documentation](video-for-android/reference) for a comprehensive description of all the classes.

## Getting Started

Before you start with the Android tutorials, please make sure that the steps below has been taken:

### Create Your Free Sinch Account

Before starting, first make sure you have a Sinch account. You can create an account with free credits using the [Sinch Dashboard](https://portal.sinch.com/#/signup) to start sending messages in minutes.

> **Information about trial mode limitations**
>
> When your account is in trial mode (such as when you've just created it), sending messages has the following limitations:
>
>  - The body of each message will be replaced by a generic message to prevent malicious uses of our API.
>  - Your messages will also be sent from a random phone number and the `sender` value will be ignored (although the API still requires a value so you must provide some value for the sender).

### Create an app in the dashboard

To be able to use the Sinch SDK a new application can be created by clicking **Apps --> Create new app**. Once the app is created the app key and secret will be visible in the dashboard. Save them, they will be used in the tutorials.

### Download the Sinch Android SDK

Download the Android SDK [here](https://sinch.readme.io/page/downloads).

Now lets get started!

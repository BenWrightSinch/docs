## Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to utilize our HTTP REST Messaging API. Wow that's a beautiful name, right? Let us just call it *XMS API*. And the XMS API service - *XMS*. That feels a lot better!

## Prerequisites

1. You have created your Sinch account
2. You have `python` and `pip` installed. If you don't, you can read about how to do it on your system [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and for `pip` [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
3. Install the [Sinch Library](https://pypi.org/project/clx-sdk-xms/) (clx-sdk-sms).

### Credentials

If you don't already have an API configured, go to your API Overview and click on the *Add new REST API* button. Your credentials will be generated and shown within seconds!

1. [Login](https://dashboard.sinch.com/login) to the dashboard.
2. Go to your [API Overview](https://dashboard.sinch.com/sms/api/rest) and find your *Service Plan ID* and *API Token*. We'll need these in our script below.

## Time to code!



## Further reading

We have an in-depth tutorial for our XMS Library [here](https://clxcommunications.github.io/sdk-xms-python/tutorial.html). It's great for getting to know what our XMS API can do!

Also feel free to read more about the API i general at the [documentation site](https://developers.sinch.com/docs/sms) contains up-to-date information about, for example, status and error codes.

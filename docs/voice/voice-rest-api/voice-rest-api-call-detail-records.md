The files are generated once every day and will contain the previous daysâ€™ CDRs. A day spans from 00:00:00 UTC to 23:59:59 UTC. CDRs are written when the call is ended, though there are some edge cases where an app-app call CDR may be delayed in being written, for example, if there is a network failure before the call is ended.

CDR files can be downloaded from the developer portal. Upon request, the CDR files can also be uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that your company provides and to which Sinch has write access.
